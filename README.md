### Overview
This program simulates an Air Field with Jets, you will be given the option of
listing the fleet, flying the fleet, finding the fastest jet, jet with highest
range, as well as the ability to load cargo, and dogfight using interfaces. Finally
you will also be able to add and remove jets from the fleet.

### Technologies Used
• Java
• Looping
• Switches
• Interfaces
• ArrayLists
• Iterators
• File Buffer/Reader

### How To Run
Run this program as a java application. Upon startup you will be greeted with
the main menu and prompted to make a selection. Use the keypad to choose desired
option. Option 1 will list the current fleet, 2 will "fly" the jets. Options
3 and 4 respectively display the fastest jet and jet with the farthest range.
Options 5 and 6 respectively load cargo and 'dogfight'. Option 7 allows the user
to create an entirely new jet with options for it to be a Fighter Jet, Cargo, or
Passenger jet. At which point you will also choose the max speed, max range, and
price of your very own jet! Option 8 will allow you to remove any jet of your
choosing from your fleet. Finally option 9 will end the program.

### Pros
This project was a great exercise and even better hands on experience with coding.
Thus far I am most proud of my work on this project, as it incorporated so many
concepts I have learned the past few weeks and hopefully is a good measure of my
progress. This project has definitely solidified more of the coursework in my mind.

### cons
As this project was the most complex we have had this past couple weeks I think
it goes without say that it definitely took a lot more time and problem solving
in some areas. My biggest obstacle this week was incorporating the instanceof
operator, Iterators, and adding objects with multiple variables into an ArrayLists
as these concepts are all still very new to me at this point in time. Despite that
being an obstacle I think this project has aided in making me a lot more comfortable
with these things.
